# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview

A Colorado Board of Education employee asked for a report of total number of votes cast, total votes and percent of votes for each cadidate and the winner of the election based on popular vote for a recent local congressional election. 

## The data we need to retrieve

1. Total number of votes cast
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
4. The voter turnout for each county
5. The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
6. The county with the highest turnout
7. Total number of votes each candidate received
8. Percentage of votes each candidate won
9. The winner of the election based on popular vote

## Resources 

* Data Source: election_results.csv 
* Software: Python 3.9.12 
* Visual Studio Code 1.70.2

## Challenge Overview

This challenge provided deep understanding of the use of python and the many challenges you will encounter while writing and modifying code.

## Challenge Summary 

This script can be modified for different purposes and to get a deeper understanding of the data. This script has shown to accurately and efficentially provide results for the local elections vote. From the data the number of votes that each candiate received and the percentage were pulled to find the winner of the election. The first example is that we could use demographics like sex, age or ethnicity to give the results more understanding and apply classification. The second example is that we could look into the cities and not just counties.  We would need to add these inputs into the election_results.csv file in order to begin the script for it. These two examples can be used for future puposes for candidates to see how to win a future election.
